.. class:: abstract

    A short version of the long version that is way too long to be written as a
    short version anyway.

.. class:: keywords

    Python, Scientific Computing.

Introduction
------------

- 3rd proceedings and 9th US conference
- # of attendees

- history

  - 10th US conference coming up
  - Europe and India, hopefully more

- move to Texas after being at Caltech for many years

- delay due to improved review criteria (discussed below)
  and a new build system

The purpose of the conference proceedings is to increase the
visibility of the conference and the presented work, as well as to
provide academic recognition of the significant contributions made by
the developers of software for science and engineering. To ensure the
published proceedings are of sufficiently high quality, we have have
instituted a formal review process in which each paper will be
reviewed by at least two reviewers according to explicit and uniform
criteria.

The primary goal of the review process is to provide independent
feedback that guide authors in improving their papers. To review a
paper, please complete the attached review form for each article you
review.

Stefan rewrote the proceedings
build system from scratch. The code is now much smaller and cleaner.
We have also been able to develop much better infrastructure and
several improvements to streamline the process going forward. You can
access the complete build system including the original restructured
text manuscripts here:

 https://github.com/scipy/proceedings-2010

- open review process

All reviews are made public including the reviewer's name. 

New Directions
--------------

- transitions and maturity theme

- first year w/ concurrent tracks

  - BioInformatics track
  - Parallel Processing & Cloud Computing track

- keynotes

  - Python Concurrency, David Beazley
  - Moving Forward from the Last Decade of SciPy, Travis Oliphant

- need to highlight a few articles

- 'we also need to organize the order of articles and explain
  that organization here'

Review and selection process
----------------------------

This year we received ... abstracts from ... different countries. The
submissions covered a number of research fields, including ....
Moreover, the articles discussed involve a number of computational tools: these
include ...
 
Each abstract was reviewed by both the program chairs as well as
two members of the program committee (PC). The PC consisted of ...
members from ... countries, and represented both industry and academia.


Abstracts were evaluated according to the following criteria:
applicability, novelty, and general impression.

We accepted 32 (...%) submissions for oral presentation at the
conference. At the end of the conference, we invited the
presenters to submit their work for publication in the
proceedings. These submissions were reviewed by ... proceedings
reviewers from ... countries, according to the following criteria:

- # of submitted papers
- # of talks
- # of papers

  - topics covered (how many fields)
  - countries represented

- reviewers

  - number of reviewers, with fields
  - countries represented

- open review process
- review template

GENERAL EVALUATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reviewer's rated each paper using the following criteria::

  below     doesn't meet standards for
            academic publication
  meets     meets or exceeds the standards
            for academic publication
  n/a       not applicable

- Quality of the approach:

- Quality of the writing:

- Quality of the figures/tables:


SPECIFIC EVALUATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the following questions, please respond with 'yes' or 'no'.  If you
answer 'no',  please provide a brief, one- to two-sentence explanation.

- Is the code made publicly available and does the article sufficiently
  describe how to access it?  We aim not to publish papers that essentially
  advertise propetiary software.  Therefore, if the code is not publicly
  available, please provide a one- to two- sentence response to each of the
  following questions: 

  - Does the article focus on a topic other than the features
    of the software itself?
  - Can the majority of statements made be externally validated
    (i.e., without the use of the software)?
  - Is the information presented of interest to readers other than
    those at whom the software is aimed?
  - Is there any other aspect of the article that would
    justify including it despite the fact that the code
    isn't available?
  - Does the article discuss the reasons the software is closed?
   
- Does the article present the problem in an appropriate context?
  Specifically, does it:
  
  - explain why the problem is important,
  - describe in which situations it arises,
  - outline relevant previous work, 
  - provide background information for non-experts 

- Is the content of the paper accessible to a computational scientist
  with no specific knowledge in the given field?

- Does the paper describe a well-formulated scientific or technical
  achievement?

- Are the technical and scientific decisions well-motivated and
  clearly explained?

- Are the code examples (if any) sound, clear, and well-written?

- Is the paper factual correct?

- Is the language and grammar of sufficient quality?

- Are the conclusions justified?

- Is prior work properly and fully cited?

- Should any part of the article be shortened or expanded? Please explain.

- In your view, is the paper fit for publication in the conference proceedings?
  Please suggest specific improvements and indicate whether you think the
  article needs a significant rewrite (rather than a minor revision).
 
From the ... original abstracts, ... (...%) have been accepted for publication
in these proceedings.

A conference the size of SciPy is only possible through hard-work and dedication
of a large number of volunteers.
